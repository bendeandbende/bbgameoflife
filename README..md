The popular zero-player game Game of Life created in React

From Conayway's Game of Life wiki:
he Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

As it is said, after choosing a game, the player isn't needed for any further actions, the game plays itself and we can enjoy the patterns it's showing us.

In this version
In the top you can check at what state (aka generation) we are at.
You can stop the state of the game, start it again.
Check the next generation with the next button
Check the previous generation with the back button
After a certain amount of time the back button is going to disappear due to the lack of backend makes it difficul to go back after a while.
Restart the game
Choose a new initial generation
Make the game faster/slower with the dedicated buttons
